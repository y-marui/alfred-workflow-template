and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `docs/alfred-workflow-notes/` — canonical, subtree-pullable reference for
  cross-project Alfred workflow development knowledge (Configuration
  Builder mechanism, `info.plist` object schema)

### Changed

- `docs/configuration-builder.md` now covers only this project's own
  Configuration Builder settings; the general mechanism reference moved
  to `docs/alfred-workflow-notes/configuration-builder.md`

### Fixed

- `docs/alfred-workflow-notes/README.md`'s "Installing in a consuming
  project" sample commands: a plain `git subtree add`/`pull` against
  `alfred-workflow-template` pulled in that repo's entire root instead of
  just `docs/alfred-workflow-notes/`, since (unlike `docs/dev-charter/`)
  the shared content here lives in a subdirectory, not at the upstream
  repo's root. Both the first-time install and the `update-workflow-notes`
  Makefile target now capture `git subtree split`'s output SHA directly
  (no named branch, so nothing that can collide with a branch the
  consuming repo already has, or needs cleanup afterwards) and run under
  `set -e` (so a failed split aborts before `merge` runs against a stale
  or empty SHA) — verified end-to-end in a sandbox repo (first-time
  install, idempotent re-run, a real update, and a forced split failure
  leaving the stash untouched rather than popped onto a broken state)
- `scripts/check-charter-subtree-edit.sh` (and its mirrored sample in
  `docs/alfred-workflow-notes/README.md`) rejected the merge commit that
  finalizes a `git subtree add`/`pull`/`merge` whenever that merge needed
  manual conflict resolution, since a plain `git commit` runs the
  pre-commit hook and the old check couldn't tell that apart from a direct
  edit under the subtree — getting the working tree stuck mid-merge. Now
  skipped only when `MERGE_HEAD` carries the `git-subtree-dir: $PREFIX`
  trailer `git subtree` itself writes, so an unrelated merge that happens
  to touch the same prefix is still blocked — verified in a sandbox repo
  (a real conflicting subtree pull now finalizes; a standalone direct edit
  and an unrelated merge touching the prefix are still rejected)
